## Creating an Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    From your organization dashboard, click on **Integrations** in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Integration">
    Click the **Create Integration** button in the upper right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Type">
    Choose the type of integration you want to create:
    - **Web Chat**: Embeddable chat widget for your website
    - **API Endpoint**: Direct API access for custom integrations
    - **Discord Bot**: Integration with Discord servers
    - **Slack Bot**: Integration with Slack organizations
    - **Microsoft Teams**: Integration with Microsoft Teams
  </Step>
  <Step title="Basic Configuration">
    Enter the following information:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your integration
    - **Description**: (Optional) A brief description of its purpose
    - **Icon/Avatar**: Upload a custom icon or choose from available options
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Knowledge Bases">
    Select one or more knowledge bases to power your integration:
    1. Click **Add Knowledge Base**
    2. Select from your available knowledge bases
    3. Set priority levels if using multiple knowledge bases
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Adjust various settings according to your needs:
    - **AI Model**: Select the underlying AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
    - **Language**: Set the primary language for responses
    - **Message History**: Configure how many previous messages to maintain as context
    - **Maximum Response Length**: Set character limits for responses
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Create** to finish setting up your integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

### AI Model Selection

Choose the right AI model for your use case:

| Model | Best For | Response Speed | Cost |
|-------|----------|----------------|------|
| **GPT-4** | Complex queries, high accuracy | Slower | Higher |
| **GPT-3.5 Turbo** | General purpose, balanced | Fast | Lower |
| **Claude** | Long-form content, analysis | Medium | Medium |

### Knowledge Base Priority

When connecting multiple knowledge bases:

1. **High Priority**: Primary sources that should be searched first
2. **Medium Priority**: Secondary sources for broader context
3. **Low Priority**: Fallback sources for edge cases

### Response Configuration

Fine-tune how your integration responds:

- **Response Length**: 50-2000 characters
- **Temperature**: Controls creativity (0.1 = focused, 0.9 = creative)
- **Context Window**: Number of previous messages to consider (1-10)

## Best Practices for Setup

- **Start Simple**: Begin with one knowledge base and expand gradually
- **Test Early**: Use the built-in chat interface to test before deploying
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate the integration's purpose
- **Appropriate Models**: Choose AI models based on your accuracy vs. speed needs
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of API usage and costs from day one
