## Widget Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Widget Not Appearing">
    **Symptoms:** The chat widget doesn't show up on your website
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check Script Installation**
       - Verify the script tag is in your HTML
       - Ensure it's placed before the closing `</body>` tag
       - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
    
    2. **Verify Integration ID**
       - Confirm the `data-app-id` matches your integration ID
       - Check for typos in the integration ID
    
    3. **Check CSS Conflicts**
       - Look for CSS rules that might hide the widget
       - Check z-index conflicts with other page elements
       
    **Quick Test:**
    ```javascript
    // Check if widget script loaded
    console.log(window.KnowFlowWidget ? 'Widget loaded' : 'Widget not loaded');
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Widget Appears But Doesn't Respond">
    **Symptoms:** Widget shows but clicking doesn't open chat or shows errors
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check Network Connectivity**
       - Open browser dev tools â†’ Network tab
       - Look for failed API requests
       - Verify your domain is allowlisted in widget settings
    
    2. **Verify Integration Status**
       - Check if your integration is active in the dashboard
       - Ensure knowledge bases are connected
       - Confirm API usage limits aren't exceeded
    
    3. **Clear Cache**
       - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
       - Clear browser cache and cookies
       - Try in incognito/private browsing mode

  <Accordion title="Trigger Buttons Not Working">
    **Symptoms:** Custom trigger buttons don't open/close the widget
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check Attribute Spelling**
       ```html
       <!-- Correct -->
       <button data-knowflow-trigger="open">Help</button>
       
       <!-- Incorrect -->
       <button data-knowflow-triggers="open">Help</button>
       ```
    
    2. **Verify Trigger Settings**
       - Ensure `enableTriggerButtons` is not set to `false`
       - Check that buttons are added to DOM after page load
    
    3. **Test Programmatic API**
       ```javascript
       // Test if API is available
       if (window.KnowFlowWidget) {
         window.KnowFlowWidget.open();
       } else {
         console.log('Widget API not available');
