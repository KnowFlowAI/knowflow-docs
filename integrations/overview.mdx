Integrations in KnowFlow are the interface between your knowledge bases and your users. They use the information you've stored to provide helpful, accurate responses across various platforms.

## What are Integrations?

Integrations in KnowFlow are customizable chatbots that leverage your knowledge bases to answer questions and provide assistance. You can deploy these integrations across multiple platforms to meet your users where they are.
