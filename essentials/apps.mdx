AI Assistants (also called "Apps" in KnowFlow) are the interface between your knowledge bases and your users. They use the information you've stored to provide helpful, accurate responses across various platforms.

## Understanding AI Assistants

AI Assistants in KnowFlow are customizable chatbots that leverage your knowledge bases to answer questions and provide assistance. You can deploy these assistants across multiple platforms to meet your users where they are.

## Customizing Assistant Behavior

### Prompt Engineering

Fine-tune how your assistant responds:

1. Go to the **Prompt** tab in your app settings
2. Customize the system prompt to guide your assistant's behavior
3. Use placeholders like `{{knowledge}}` where retrieved information should be inserted
4. Save your changes

Example system prompt:
```
You are a helpful support assistant for {{company_name}}. 
Use the following information to answer the user's question:
{{knowledge}}

If you don't know the answer based on the given information, say so politely 
and offer to connect the user with a human agent.
```

### Response Templates

Create templated responses for common queries:

1. Go to the **Templates** tab in your app settings
2. Click **Add Template**
3. Enter a trigger phrase or question pattern
4. Enter the response template
5. Save your template

### Fallback Configuration

Set up fallback options when your assistant can't answer:

1. Go to the **Fallbacks** tab
2. Configure:
   - Custom "I don't know" messages
   - Human handoff options
   - Alternative suggestions
   - Feedback collection

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Conversation History

View all interactions with your assistant:

1. Go to the **Conversations** tab
2. Browse through conversation threads
3. Filter by date, user, or content
4. Export conversations for further analysis

### Performance Metrics

Track how well your assistant is performing:

1. Go to the **Analytics** tab
2. View metrics such as:
   - Total conversations
   - Average conversation length
   - Response time
   - User satisfaction ratings
   - Knowledge base coverage

### Knowledge Gaps

Identify areas where your assistant needs improvement:

1. Go to the **Knowledge Gaps** tab
2. View questions the assistant couldn't answer confidently
3. Use these insights to update your knowledge bases

## Best Practices

- **Start focused**: Begin with a specific use case and expand as you gain confidence
- **Test thoroughly**: Use the chat interface to test various scenarios before deploying
- **Iterative improvement**: Regularly review conversations and refine your assistant
- **Clear expectations**: Set appropriate welcome messages to guide users on what they can ask
- **Use multiple knowledge bases**: Connect specialized knowledge bases for different topics
- **Monitor continuously**: Regularly check analytics to identify improvement opportunities

## Troubleshooting
