# Knowledge Sources

Knowledge sources are the foundation of your KnowFlow integrations. They contain the information that your AI assistants use to provide accurate, helpful responses to users.

## What are Knowledge Sources?

Knowledge sources are collections of information that you can import into KnowFlow from various formats and platforms. These sources become the training data for your AI assistants, enabling them to answer questions based on your specific content.

## Types of Knowledge Sources

### File Uploads
- **Documents**: PDF, Word, text files
- **Spreadsheets**: Excel, CSV files
- **Presentations**: PowerPoint files
- **Code**: Markdown, code files

### Web Sources
- **Websites**: Crawl entire websites or specific pages
- **Documentation Sites**: Import from existing documentation
- **APIs**: Connect to external data sources

### Integrations
- **GitHub**: Import repositories and documentation
- **Slack**: Historical conversations and knowledge
- **Notion**: Pages and databases
- **Confluence**: Team documentation

## Managing Knowledge Sources

### Adding Sources
1. Navigate to your knowledge base
2. Click **Add Source**
3. Choose your source type
4. Configure import settings
5. Review and confirm

### Source Quality
- **Structured Content**: Well-organized content performs better
- **Clear Language**: Simple, clear writing improves accuracy
- **Regular Updates**: Keep sources current for best results

### Best Practices
- Organize content logically
- Use clear headings and structure

## Source Processing

When you add a knowledge source, KnowFlow:
1. **Extracts** text and structure
2. **Chunks** content into manageable pieces
3. **Indexes** for fast retrieval
4. **Optimizes** for AI understanding
