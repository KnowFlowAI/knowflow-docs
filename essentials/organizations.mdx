Organizations are the top-level organizational units in KnowFlow that help you manage different projects, teams, and resources. They provide a way to segment your work and control access to knowledge bases and AI assistants.

## Understanding Organizations

An organization in KnowFlow is a dedicated environment where you can create and manage knowledge bases, AI assistants, and team members. Organizations help you organize your projects and control who has access to specific resources.
