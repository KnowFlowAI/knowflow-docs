description: 'Complete reference for the KnowFlow API'
---

The KnowFlow API allows you to programmatically manage your knowledge bases, AI assistants, and user interactions. This reference provides detailed information about available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

## Authentication

All API requests (except registration and login) require authentication using a Bearer token.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.knowflow.in/v1/organizations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

### Obtaining an API Token

You can generate an API token in the KnowFlow dashboard:

1. Log in to your KnowFlow account
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New API Key**
4. Name your API key and set permissions
5. Copy the generated token (it will only be shown once)

## Base URL

All API endpoints use the following base URL:

```
https://api.knowflow.in/v1
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. A typical response includes:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

For error responses:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human-readable error message"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API has rate limits to ensure fair usage. Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 98
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1635753600
```

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following query parameters:

- `page`: Page number (starting from 1)
- `limit`: Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)

Paginated responses include metadata:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    // Array of items
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 120,
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 20,
    "pages": 6
  }
}
```

## Error Codes

Common error codes you may encounter:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `authentication_error` | Invalid or missing API token |
| `permission_denied` | Insufficient permissions for the requested action |
| `resource_not_found` | The requested resource does not exist |
| `validation_error` | Invalid request parameters |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests, try again later |
| `server_error` | Internal server error |

## API Versioning

The API version is included in the URL path (`/v1/`). When breaking changes are introduced, a new version will be released (e.g., `/v2/`). We recommend specifying the API version in your integration to ensure compatibility.

## Webhooks

KnowFlow supports webhooks for real-time event notifications. You can configure webhooks in the dashboard under **Settings** → **Webhooks**.

Available events include:

- `conversation.created`
- `conversation.message.created`
- `knowledge_base.updated`
- `app.deployment.updated`
